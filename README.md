## How It Works

- **Frontend** pages use modular components from `Komponente.vb` to render headers, footers, and product lists.
- **AJAX** is used for cart operations and order processing, providing a seamless user experience without full page reloads.
- **Database** operations are performed via ADO.NET and stored procedures, ensuring security and performance.
- **Session** is used to track the user's cart and (optionally) login state.
- **URL formatting** and SEO are handled by utility functions (e.g., `SrediNaziv`) to ensure clean, user-friendly links.
